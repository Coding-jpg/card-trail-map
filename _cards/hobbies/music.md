# Music Production Journey

I've been creating electronic music for over 3 years, focusing on ambient soundscapes and atmospheric textures. What started as a creative outlet has become a serious passion that influences my approach to coding.

## Current Projects

### "Digital Dreams" EP
Working on a 5-track ambient album exploring the intersection of technology and nature. Each track represents a different aspect of our digital lives.

### Game Soundtrack Collaboration
Partnering with an indie game developer to create an adaptive soundtrack that responds to player actions.

## Equipment & Software

- **DAW**: Ableton Live Suite
- **Hardware**: Push 2, Audio Interface, Studio Monitors
- **Plugins**: Native Instruments Komplete, FabFilter Pro-Q 3
- **Field Recording**: Zoom H1n for capturing environmental sounds

## What Music Teaches Me

- **Patience**: Good music takes time to develop, just like good code
- **Iteration**: Constantly refining and improving until it feels right
- **User Experience**: Considering how the listener will experience the journey
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding signal flow, automation, and optimization
