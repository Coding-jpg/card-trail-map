# SoundScape: AI Music Discovery

SoundScape is a web application that uses machine learning to analyze users' music preferences and provide personalized recommendations. It combines my passion for music with my technical skills to create something truly unique.

## The Problem

Existing music platforms often rely on simple collaborative filtering, which can lead to echo chambers and limited discovery. I wanted to build something that truly understands musical characteristics and can surprise users with unexpected but relevant recommendations.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Modern React with hooks and TypeScript for type safety
- Custom audio visualization using Web Audio API
- Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Real-time updates using WebSockets

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- RESTful API with comprehensive documentation
- PostgreSQL database with optimized queries
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- JWT authentication with refresh token rotation

### AI/ML Pipeline (Python + TensorFlow)
- Audio feature extraction using librosa
- Deep learning model for similarity analysis
- Clustering algorithms for genre classification
- Real-time recommendation engine

## Key Features

### Smart Playlists
Automatically generated playlists based on mood, activity, or musical characteristics rather than just genre.

### Audio Analysis
Visual representation of song structure, including tempo changes, key modulations, and emotional intensity.

### Social Discovery
Share musical "DNA" with friends and discover new music through trusted recommendations.

### Offline Mode
Progressive Web App with offline capabilities for analyzing local music libraries.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Performance Optimization
- Implemented lazy loading for audio files
- Used Web Workers for heavy computational tasks
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing

### User Experience
- Designed intuitive onboarding flow
- Created smooth animations and transitions
- Implemented comprehensive error handling

### Scalability
- Containerized application with Docker
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Implemented horizontal scaling strategy

## Results & Impact

The application has grown to over 2,500 active users who have collectively analyzed more than 150,000 songs. The recommendation accuracy sits at 87% based on user feedback and engagement metrics.

## What I Learned

This project pushed me to integrate multiple technologies and think about user experience at every level. It reinforced my belief that the best applications solve real problems while being technically excellent and delightfully usable.
